                <p>We are committed to maintaining your privacy.</p>

                <p>Data collected on our website will not be disclosed, sold, or
                    licensed to third parties for commercial or personal reasons. If
                    our company comes under legal obligation, however, some of your
                    information may be disclosed to the extent that is required.</p>

                <p><strong>DATA COLLECTION</strong></p>

                <p>Websites built on certain platforms (for example: Microsoft
                    SharePoint) utilize HTTP cookies for the transference of data and
                    to support functionality. While they can be used to monitor your
                    activity on the site, they do not carry viruses, and cannot install
                    malware on your computer.</p>

                <p>This site will also record your Internet Protocol (IP) Address.
                    This is for purposes of IP identification only, not to identify the
                    individual browser.</p>

                <p>We will not send you any unsolicited email as a result of your
                    visit to this site, and we do not seek to collect excessive
                    personal information.</p>

                <p>You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you.
                    You can find out what that is by contacting us directly.</p>

                <p><strong>OTHER SITES</strong></p>

                <p>Our site includes links to and from other websites. If you
                    follow a link to another website, please note that these sites have
                    their own privacy statements, policies, and terms of condition
                    regarding use, and that we do not accept responsibility or
                    liability for their actions. Please use caution before submitting
                    personal data to any website.</p>

                <p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>

                <p>We will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure the
                    security of your data. Please be aware, however, that the
                    transmission of information via the Internet is never completely
                    secure.</p>

                <p><strong>CHANGES</strong></p>

                <p>Any changes made in regards to our privacy policies will be
                    posted here.</p>
